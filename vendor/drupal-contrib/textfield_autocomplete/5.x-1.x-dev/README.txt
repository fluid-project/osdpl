textfield_autocomplete

README

Description
------------

This module defines a new CCK field:  Textfield with autocomplete.  Add it to
your content types, and you will have a nifty autocompleting textfield.  The
values that show up in the autocomplete are a list of all values that the field
currently takes.  That makes it easy to re-use values that have been entered
before.


Installation
------------

Unpack the tarball and install in your modules directory.  Enable it on the
modules admin page.
